# Welcome to Traffic!
It is a board game. Your job is to move the cars (represented by colored rectangles) forwards and backwards so that the red car can exit through the gap on the right edge.

After the start of the game you will see the list of available levels. It will be empty if you do it for the first time. In order to add levels click the button on the right. They will start to be created in the background. The process will be indicated by a blue rectangle displayed in the level list. Once the work is finished it will change and the created board will be displayed. You should try to create several levels at once because the process takes some randomness and if you are not lucky it may take a very long time. Trying it a few times reducess the chances of such situation.

When the levels are created, you can select one of them and cick the 'Start level' button.

All of your created levels will be automatically saved and you can play them next time.
